# Hyperspectral-image-classification-using-deep-learning

Hyper spectral image (HSI) classification is the most important and a dominant topic in remote sensing, whose complex characteristics help in  the accurate classification of HSI. 
The abundant information provided by the HSI images is used for various applications in the fields like mineralogy, agriculture, physics, astronomy, chemical imaging, surveillance
and environmental sciences. In this paper, classification of hyper spectral images is done on the  dataset Indian Pines using three methods 1)CNN-a Convolutional Neural Network 
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron are used for encoding  pixel's spectral and spatial information and  conduct the classification task respectively, which gave an accuracy of
99.53 percent.2)MLP-a classical type of neural network which has multiple layers for classification that gives an accuracy of   3)HybridSN-a spectral-spatial 3D-CNN along with 
spatial 2D-CNN gives an accuracy of 92 percent accuracy.
